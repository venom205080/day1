# -------- yi = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 +...+ ϵ  -----------

# yi​ is the dependent or predicted variable
# β0 is the y-intercept, i.e., the value of y when both x1 and x2 are 0.
# β1 and β2 are the regression coefficients representing the change in y relative to a one-unit change in xi1 and xi2, respectively.
# βp is the slope coefficient for each independent variable
# ϵ is the model’s random error (residual) term.
